If GTunlock crashes or does not works as it should, there is file in main folder named: system_telemetry.txt
Everytime you open GTunlock, a small program in it will detect and write telemetry data like:
OS info
GPU info
PC info
RAM info
CPU info

These data will/can be used to solve problems with the program.

how to do it:
1. find system_telemetry.txt
2 copy the file into github issues
3. tell everything what happened when you ran the program.
4. send and wait until i will respond
